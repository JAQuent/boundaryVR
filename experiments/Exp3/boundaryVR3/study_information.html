In this experiment you will be shown a video depicting navigation through rooms and will then be asked questions about the video. Prior to starting, we test your connection speed and browser so we can verify that the movies can be played. The whole session should last around est_time minutes. You may take short breaks, but bear in mind you must finish the session within max_time minutes.<br><br>Anonymised electronic research data will be stored on the hosting site’s servers that are compliant with EU data protection and security policies, and data transfer will be encrypted.<br><br>We will not have access to identifying information (PID) like name, IP address or bank details; only demographic information (e.g. age, gender, language).<br><br>In addition to your responses during the study, we collect information about the device, operating system and web browser that you’re using.
