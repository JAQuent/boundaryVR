I was focused mainly about the size of object and I was actively comparing it to shoe box in my head. It was surprising that is was all about memory. But overall instructions was clear."},"general_comments":"If you could give a little clue what will be the test about, I think more answers would be correct. I realised that our minds just skip some informations that we see probably to save space in our brains. For example we don't remember the way of going into university (trees, path, if the sky was cloudy or not, if we saw the STOP sign or not) because it is not necessary for us to live. We remember most things when something is new and it shocks us or when we are really focused on our task."}
