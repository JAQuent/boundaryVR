As well as the wall color for the '2' position was different than the '1' position with the wall color being the same when I first walked in as it was in the '1' so I think that also added to that feeling. "},"q5":{"q_id":"room_feeling2","answer":"easierWith","survey":"It was hard to remember either way, but I noticed with a lot of the piece I could place the object after it in the corner or '1' position easier with the partition. "},"q6":{"q_id":"room_feeling3","answer":"yes","survey":"The wall itself made it feel like a new room, it was also the layout too as the partition extended a far bit into the room and from my view-point, it felt large. The wall color as mentioned in my previous response also helped this feeling of walking into a new room as well. "},"q7":{"q_id":"object_recognition","answer":"nearlyAll","survey":"I have to say I remember all of the objects for the most part but I do not recall a calculator. Maybe I was not able to see it clearly enough in my mind and instead just thought it was a blob or a shape but that's okay!"},"q8":{"q_id":"exp_problems","answer":"no","survey":""},"q9":{"q_id":"navigation","answer":"no"},"q10":{"q_id":"object_time","answer":"yes"},"q11":{"q_id":"memory1","answer":"expNone"},"q12":{"q_id":"memory2","answer":"no","survey":""},"q13":{"q_id":"instructions","answer":"no","survey":""},"general_comments":"I cannot imagine all the work that went into designing and implementing this experiment and I just wanted to say it was engaging and smooth!
