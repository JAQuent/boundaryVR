I was particularly looking for strong connections that later one would help me guess which one follows. For example, I related dumbbells and pillow which both relate to fitness like training and resting. For some it was easier for others it was harder I did not make any connection so I moved on with these ones."},"q10":{"q_id":"strategy2","answer":"often","survey":"I think Yes I based my guess on the objects I recalled were in order. However, I'm not sure if I have fully understood this questions."},"q11":{"q_id":"instructions","answer":"no","survey":"I think it was clear. The memory task consist of recalling which object follows which. There is a given object and three possible objects from which one follows the given object in the sequence. The instructions are clear."},"general_comments":"All good. Took me around 33 minutes to complete all this study."}
